# A method to find the first and second order derivatives in R
```{r}
# first derivative
D(f,'x')

# second derivative
D(D(f,'x'),'x')
```

## Determine if the following functions are differentiable
$$
f(x, y)=\frac{10 x^2 \cdot e^y}{2 y}
$$

$$
g(x,y) = ln(x) + 10 \cdot y
$$
$$
j(x, y)=x^2+y^2
$$
$$
h(x, y)=\frac{x^2+y}{e^x+y}
$$

## Determine the gradients of the following functions
$$
f(x, y)=10 x^2+e^y
$$
$$
f(x,y) = x^3+10 \cdot x \cdot y + 4 \cdot y + 20 
$$
$$
f(x, y)=\sin \left(x^2+5+y\right)
$$

## Describe what the Hessian is and name at least one of its characteristics

## Why are gradients important?
Gradients are the foundation for some of the most important concepts in machine learning.
They are key to how for instance a neural network learns by finding by approaching a minimum in the so-called loss function.
